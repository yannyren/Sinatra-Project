# week_5_project_1_brief

CodeClan needs a system to track all the students who have got jobs so far. 

The web app must include:

-students information 

-company information

-students employment record

MVP:

• A list of all their students with name, gender, cohort, graduation date and their current employment status

• A list of all companies that have recruited CodeClan students and all the students currently working for them

• CRUD actions for students/companies

• Assign a student to a company when they get recruited

Possible Extensions:

•Have a separate page for all the jobs currently taken by CodeClan students

•All the job types and description 

•Be able to upload company logos and information 

•Be able to upload student pictures and information



Note: 

Due to CodeClan’s limited budget, client wants more functionalities and only need minimum CSS.
